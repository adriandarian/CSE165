# CSE 165/ENGR 140: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

## Lab 3

1. In this lab you will be creating a "clone" of MS Paint program. That is, the user should be able to draw things on the screen by dragging with the mouse.
2. You do not need to include all the features found in the real MS Paint. All you need to do is have the ability to switch between different colors, and the ability to switch between a paintbrush tool and an eraser tool.
3. Optionally, you may implement more tools, such as drawing lines, shapes, etc. You may also implement a selector for the brush thickness.
4. You are _required_ to make use of data abstraction and encapsulation techniques covered in class. This means making objects that interact with each other. Your objects should have the appropriate access control.
